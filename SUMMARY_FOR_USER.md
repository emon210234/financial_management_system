## 💡 Key Concepts You'll Master

### 1. Branching
```
main (protected, always working)
├── feature/your-work (your experiments)
└── feature/friend-work (friend's experiments)
```
**Never work directly on main!**

### 2. The Golden Workflow
```
1. Update main (git pull origin main)
2. Create branch (git checkout -b feature/new-thing)
3. Make changes
4. Commit (git commit -m "Clear message")
5. Push (git push origin feature/new-thing)
6. Create Pull Request on GitHub
7. Get review from friend
8. Merge to main
```

### 3. Avoiding Conflicts
- Communicate what you're working on
- Pull frequently (git pull origin main)
- Work on different files when possible
- Merge branches within 1-3 days
